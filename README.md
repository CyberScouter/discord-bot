# Discord Bot
The Discord bot used on the official HTW FB4 Discord server

## Setup
To work properly, the Discord bot needs to be registered with the Discord API first.
When creating a Discord bot in the online interface, you'll get an API key which can be used by the bot to log into a Discord server.
This API key needs to be stored in a file called `key.txt`, which has to be in the same directory as the `main.py` file.

To install the required dependencies for this project (i.e. the Python Discord API), 
run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before starting the bot for the first time.

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the bot
To run the bot, you simply need to execute `python main.py` from the command line.
